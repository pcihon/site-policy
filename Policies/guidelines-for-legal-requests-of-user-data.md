**Private account data** —
GitHub also collects and maintains certain private information about users as outlined in our [Privacy Policy](/articles/github-privacy-statement).
This may include:
  - Private email addresses
  - Payment details
  - Security access logs
  - Data about interactions with private repositories

  To get a sense of the type of private account information that GitHub collects, you can visit your {% data reusables.user_settings.personal_dashboard %} and browse through the sections in the left-hand menubar.

**Organization account data** —
Information about organizations, their administrative users and repositories is publicly available on GitHub.
Organization profiles can be found at a URL such as `https://github.com/organization`.
Public organization profiles can also include additional information that the owners have chosen to share publicly.
All organization public profiles display:
  - The organization name
  - The repositories that the owners have starred
  - All GitHub users that are owners of the organization

  Optionally, administrative users may also choose to share the following information publicly:
  - An avatar
  - An affiliated company
  - Their location
  - Direct Members and Teams
  - Collaborators

- <a name="public-repository-data"></a>
**Public repository data** —
GitHub is home to millions of public, open-source software projects.
You can browse almost any public repository (for example, the [Atom Project](https://github.com/atom/atom)) to get a sense for the information that GitHub collects and maintains about repositories.
This can include:

  - Contents of secret Gists
  - Source code or other content in private repositories
  - Contribution and collaboration records for private repositories
  - Communications or documentation (such as Issues or Wikis) in private repositories
  - Any security keys used for authentication or encryption

- <a name="in-exigent-circumstances"></a>
**Under exigent circumstances** —
If we receive a request for information under certain exigent circumstances (where we believe the disclosure is necessary to prevent an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury to a person), we may disclose limited information that we determine necessary to enable law enforcement to address the emergency. For any information beyond that, we would require a subpoena, search warrant, or court order, as described above. For example, we will not disclose contents of private repositories without a search warrant. Before disclosing information, we confirm that the request came from a law enforcement agency, an authority sent an official notice summarizing the emergency, and how the information requested will assist in addressing the emergency.

### Cost reimbursement

We reserve the right to seek reimbursement for administrative costs associated with responding to requests for information, as allowed by law.

### Data preservation

We will take steps to preserve account records for up to 90 days upon formal request from U.S. law enforcement in connection with official criminal investigations, and pending the issuance of a court order or other process.

### Submitting requests

Please serve requests to:

```
GitHub, Inc.
c/o Corporation Service Company
2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N
Sacramento, CA 95833-3505
```

Please make your requests as specific and narrow as possible, including the following information:

- Full information about authority issuing the request for information
- The name and badge/ID of the responsible agent
- An official email address and contact phone number
- The user, organization, repository name(s) of interest
- The URLs of any pages, gists or files of interest
- The description of the types of records you need

Please allow at least two weeks for us to be able to look into your request.

### Requests from foreign law enforcement

As a United States company based in California, GitHub is not required to provide data to foreign governments in response to legal process issued by foreign authorities.
Foreign law enforcement officials wishing to request information from GitHub should contact the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs.
GitHub will promptly respond to requests that are issued via U.S. court by way of a mutual legal assistance treaty (“MLAT”) or letter rogatory.
