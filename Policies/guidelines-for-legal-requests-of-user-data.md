**Private account data** —
GitHub also collects and maintains certain private information about users as outlined in our [Privacy Policy](/articles/github-privacy-statement).
This may include:
  - Private email addresses
  - Payment details
  - Security access logs
  - Data about interactions with private repositories

  To get a sense of the type of private account information that GitHub collects, you can visit your {% data reusables.user_settings.personal_dashboard %} and browse through the sections in the left-hand menubar.

- <a name="organization-account-data"></a>
**Organization account data** —
Information about organizations, their administrative users and repositories is publicly available on GitHub.
Organization profiles can be found at a URL such as `https://github.com/organization`.
Public organization profiles can also include additional information that the owners have chosen to share publicly.
All organization public profiles display:
  - The organization name
  - The repositories that the owners have starred
  - All GitHub users that are owners of the organization

  Optionally, administrative users may also choose to share the following information publicly:
  - An avatar
  - An affiliated company
  - Their location
  - Direct Members and Teams
  - Collaborators

- <a name="public-repository-data"></a>
**Public repository data** —
GitHub is home to millions of public, open-source software projects.
You can browse almost any public repository (for example, the [Atom Project](https://github.com/atom/atom)) to get a sense for the information that GitHub collects and maintains about repositories.
This can include:

  - The code itself
  - Previous versions of the code
  - Stable release versions of the project
  - Information about collaborators, contributors and repository members
  - Logs of Git operations such as commits, branching, pushing, pulling, forking and cloning
  - Conversations related to Git operations such as comments on pull requests or commits
  - Project documentation such as Issues and Wiki pages
  - Statistics and graphs showing contributions to the project and the network of contributors

- <a name="private-repository-data"></a>
**Private repository data** —
GitHub collects and maintains the same type of data for private repositories that can be seen for public repositories, except only specifically invited users may access private repository data.

- <a name="other-data"></a>
**Other data** —
Additionally, GitHub collects analytics data such as page visits and information occasionally volunteered by our users (such as communications with our support team, survey information and/or site registrations).

### We will notify any affected account owners

It is our policy to notify users about any pending requests regarding their accounts or repositories, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so. Before disclosing user information, we will make a reasonable effort to notify any affected account owner(s) by sending a message to their verified email address providing them with a copy of the subpoena, court order, or warrant so that they can have an opportunity to challenge the legal process if they wish. In (rare) exigent circumstances, we may delay notification if we determine delay is necessary to prevent death or serious harm.

### Disclosure of non-public information

It is our policy to disclose non-public user information in connection with a civil or criminal investigation only with user consent or upon receipt of a valid subpoena, civil investigative demand, court order, search warrant, or other similar valid legal process. In certain exigent circumstances (see below), we also may share limited information but only corresponding to the nature of the circumstances, and would require legal process for anything beyond that.
GitHub reserves the right to object to any requests for non-public information.
Where GitHub agrees to produce non-public information in response to a lawful request, we will conduct a reasonable search for the requested information.
Here are the kinds of information we will agree to produce, depending on the kind of legal process we are served with:

- <a name="with-user-consent"></a>
**With user consent** —
GitHub will provide private account information, if requested, directly to the user (or an owner, in the case of an organization account), or to a designated third party with the user's written consent once GitHub is satisfied that the user has verified his or her identity.

- <a name="with-a-subpoena"></a>
**With a subpoena** —
If served with a valid subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar legal process issued in connection with an official criminal or civil investigation, we can provide certain non-public account information, which may include:

  - Name(s) associated with the account
  - Email address(es) associated with the account
  - Billing information
  - Registration date and termination date
  - IP address, date, and time at the time of account registration
  - IP address(es) used to access the account at a specified time or event relevant to the investigation

In the case of organization accounts, we can provide the name(s) and email address(es) of the account owner(s) as well as the date and IP address at the time of creation of the organization account. We will not produce information about other members or contributors, if any, to the organization account or any additional information regarding the identified account owner(s) without a follow-up request for those specific users.

Please note that the information available will vary from case to case. Some of the information is optional for users to provide. In other cases, we may not have collected or retained the information.

- <a name="with-a-court-order-or-a-search-warrant"></a>
**With a court order *or* a search warrant** — We will not disclose account access logs unless compelled to do so by either
(i) a court order issued under 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(d), upon a showing of specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation; or
(ii) a search warrant issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures, upon a showing of probable cause.
In addition to the non-public user account information listed above, we can provide account access logs in response to a court order or search warrant, which may include:

  - Any logs which would reveal a user's movements over a period of time
  - Account or private repository settings (for example, which users have certain permissions, etc.)
  - User- or IP-specific analytic data such as browsing history
  - Security access logs other than account creation or for a specific time and date

- <a name="only-with-a-search-warrant"></a>
**Only with a search warrant** —
We will not disclose the private contents of any user account unless compelled to do so under a search warrant issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures upon a showing of probable cause.
In addition to the non-public user account information and account access logs mentioned above, we will also provide private user account contents in response to a search warrant, which may include:

  - Contents of secret Gists
  - Source code or other content in private repositories
  - Contribution and collaboration records for private repositories
  - Communications or documentation (such as Issues or Wikis) in private repositories
  - Any security keys used for authentication or encryption

- <a name="in-exigent-circumstances"></a>
**Under exigent circumstances** —
If we receive a request for information under certain exigent circumstances (where we believe the disclosure is necessary to prevent an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury to a person), we may disclose limited information that we determine necessary to enable law enforcement to address the emergency. For any information beyond that, we would require a subpoena, search warrant, or court order, as described above. For example, we will not disclose contents of private repositories without a search warrant. Before disclosing information, we confirm that the request came from a law enforcement agency, an authority sent an official notice summarizing the emergency, and how the information requested will assist in addressing the emergency.

### Cost reimbursement

We reserve the right to seek reimbursement for administrative costs associated with responding to requests for information, as allowed by law.

### Data preservation

We will take steps to preserve account records for up to 90 days upon formal request from U.S. law enforcement in connection with official criminal investigations, and pending the issuance of a court order or other process.

```
GitHub, Inc.

### Requests from foreign law enforcement

As a United States company based in California, GitHub is not required to provide data to foreign governments in response to legal process issued by foreign authorities.
Foreign law enforcement officials wishing to request information from GitHub should contact the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs.
GitHub will promptly respond to requests that are issued via U.S. court by way of a mutual legal assistance treaty (“MLAT”) or letter rogatory.
