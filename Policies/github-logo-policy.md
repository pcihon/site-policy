You can also use an octocat as your personal avatar or on your website to link to your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account, but not for your company or a product you're building. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} has an extensive collection of octocats in the [Octodex](https://octodex.github.com/). For more information on using the octocats from the Octodex, see the [Octodex FAQ](https://octodex.github.com/faq/).
