#### 9. Privacy

GitHub may collect information about how Customer uses GitHub Connect and how GitHub can improve it. Customer may enable GitHub Connect to authorize GitHub to collect protected data, which includes private repository data and Customer Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement), from Customer's Enterprise account. If Customer connects its Enterprise instance with its GitHub.com account, Customer sends identifying instance information to GitHub.com, which information is governed by [GitHub’s Privacy Statement](/articles/github-privacy-statement/). By enabling this configuration, Customer agrees that it is responsible for the actions that are performed on or through its account, subject to the terms of its Generally Applicable Terms.

GitHub may collect certain additional personal information from Customer in GitHub Connect. For example, GitHub may invite Customer to send Feedback (as explained in Section 10). GitHub may ask questions about Customer’s users’ experiences, familiarity with the product, or demographic information. GitHub will use this information to improve its products and services, and will not sell it to third parties or advertisers. Customer may decline to give feedback, decline to answer specific questions, or contact GitHub to delete or alter the information it has provided.

GitHub's servers are located in the United States. GitHub processes and controls Customer’s data in the United States. However, Customer is solely responsible for determining what personal data it submits to GitHub. Please refer to our [Privacy Statement](/articles/github-privacy-statement/) for more information.

#### 10. Feedback

Customer may, at its option, provide ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for GitHub Connect or GitHub’s other products or services (collectively, “Feedback”).
