### Training for our employees

GitHub employees are required to participate in training on corruption, including bribery. We also provide additional training for particularly relevant people and teams, such as our sales team. The training explains relevant elements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. For example,
- definition and structural effects of corruption
- who is covered, including
   - public officials or others in a position of power
   - third parties
- what kind of activity is covered, including
   - cash, gifts, travel, and entertainment
   - facilitation payments
   - charitable contributions and sponsorship
- for what purpose, including
   - intent
   - improper advantage or influence
- due diligence and red flags
- record-keeping requirements

In addition, the training covers GitHub’s internal policies related to anti-corruption and bribery, including our non-retaliation (whistleblower) policy.

While the U.S. FCPA is focused on interactions with government officials, the U.K. Bribery Act is broader and extends to bribing anyone, regardless of whether they are a government official. Both laws can extend to GitHub’s actions elsewhere on the globe. GitHub’s policies prohibit bribing anyone, anywhere in the world.

### Engaging our Partners
- GitHub’s standard **resale agreements with Channel Partners** include mandatory anti-corruption clauses. Going forward, GitHub now requires our Channel Partners to commit to complying with this Anti-Corruption Statement.
- Going forward, GitHub’s **vendor contracts** now require a commitment to comply with Microsoft's Supplier Code of Conduct or this Anti-Corruption Statement.
