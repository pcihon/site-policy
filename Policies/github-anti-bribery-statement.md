In addition, the training covers GitHub’s internal policies related to anti-corruption and bribery, including our non-retaliation (whistleblower) policy.

While the U.S. FCPA is focused on interactions with government officials, the U.K. Bribery Act is broader and extends to bribing anyone, regardless of whether they are a government official. Both laws can extend to GitHub’s actions elsewhere on the globe. GitHub’s policies prohibit bribing anyone, anywhere in the world.

### Engaging our Partners
- GitHub’s standard **resale agreements with Channel Partners** include mandatory anti-corruption clauses. Going forward, GitHub now requires our Channel Partners to commit to complying with this Anti-Corruption Statement.
- Going forward, GitHub’s **vendor contracts** now require a commitment to comply with Microsoft's Supplier Code of Conduct or this Anti-Corruption Statement.
