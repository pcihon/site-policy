  You need to have an account on GitHub.com in order to participate in the Program.  By clicking “I Agree” at the bottom of this Agreement, you are also agreeing to be bound by the GitHub.com [Terms of Service](/articles/github-terms-of-service) (the “TOS”). In the event of a direct conflict between this Agreement and theTOS, this Agreement will control; otherwise, both agreements will apply to you concurrently.
